#Overview:

This report analyzes coffee sales performance across multiple metrics to help drive data-informed decisions. Key areas of focus include total sales, order volume, and regional performance from 2019 to 2022. The analysis covers sales trends by coffee roast types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, and Robusta), sales by country, customer purchasing patterns, and top-performing customers.

#Approach:

•	Data Collection: Sales data from 2019 to 2022 was gathered, focusing on various dimensions like roast types, order sizes, and customer engagement (loyalty card usage).

•	Tools: The dataset was analyzed and visualized using Excel. Filters such as roast type, size, and loyalty status were used to allow a deep dive into the sales performance of specific groups.

•	Visualization: The dashboard illustrates total sales trends over time, regional sales distribution, and top customer contributions. It provides an interactive, overview of key performance indicators (KPIs).

#Insights:

•	Total Sales & Orders: A total of $45,134 in sales was generated from 1,000 orders during the analyzed period.

•	Sales Trends: Peaks in sales can be observed in certain months (e.g., late 2020 and early 2021). Among the coffee types, Arabica had the highest volatility in sales trends.

•	Regional Performance: The United States accounted for the majority of sales, contributing $36,000, followed by Ireland ($7,000) and the United Kingdom ($3,000).

•	Top Customers: The top 5 customers contributed significantly to overall revenue, with Allis Wilmore leading with over $320 in purchases.

#Recommendations:

•	Target Market Expansion: Given that the U.S. dominates the sales, efforts to expand the market in Ireland and the U.K. could yield additional growth.

•	Customer Engagement Programs: The top 5 customers show strong loyalty. Expanding customer loyalty programs or special promotions could help boost sales further among both new and returning customers.

•	Seasonal Sales Strategy: The sales trend suggests fluctuations in demand. Optimizing marketing strategies around the peak sales months and addressing lower sales periods could stabilize the sales flow.

•	Product Offering Review: Since Arabica shows more volatility, it may benefit from additional marketing focus or promotional offers to stabilize its performance.
